something about issues, other things to think about.

If you've found a bug, please raise a [bug report](https://github.com/booyaa/roadmappy/issues/new?template=bugs.md).

If the process could be improve, then raise a [process issue](https://github.com/booyaa/roadmappy/issues/new?template=process.md).

If you've only got a few minutes to spare then why not:

- Triage some existing issues
- Add missing meeting minutes
- Water the house plants
